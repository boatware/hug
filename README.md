# boatware/hug

Usable interfaces for the (sadly) abandoned PSR-8 Huggable Interface.

Initial work by Larry Garfield ([@Crell](https://github.com/Crell)) can be found [here](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/tree/master/proposed/psr-8-hug).

## Usage

Install via composer:

```bash
composer require boatware/hug
```

Then, spread some love in your PHP objects ðŸ’•.
